    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **demographic data to find prospective clients**. They can help in streamlining a marketing budget and in making informed decisions on the target market that the business is focused on. In the absence of decision trees, the business may spend its marketing market without a specific demographic in mind, which will affect its overall revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Resistant to outliers\n",
    "    - No tendency to underfit\n",
    "    - Assumptions: Decision tree doesn’t have any underlying data assumptions.\n",
    "    - Good for class skewed data: Decision tree performs well for class skewed\n",
    "    - Work well with categorical and continuous data\n",
    "\n",
    "**- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Tendency to overfit\n",
    "    - Not good for regression: Decision Tree can be used for regression but decision tree won’t perform well.\n",
    "    - Train/Test time: Comparing to logistics regression decision Tree takes more time for training and it is slower for             testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem has both numerical and categorical data which decision trees can handle pretty well. Additionally, interpretation of decision trees being easy, this will help us to understand better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis**; One of the most prominent areas of machine learning is sentiment analysis, and this algorithm is quite useful there as well. Sentiment analysis focuses on identifying whether the customers think positively or negatively about a certain topic (product or service). Netflix or Amazon are big and prominent companies that use recommender system to suggest products to their clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",
    "    - Very simple, easy to implement and fast\n",
    "    - If the NB conditional independence assumption holds, then it will converge quicker than discriminative models like             logistic regression\n",
    "    - Even if the NB assumption doesn’t hold, it works great in practice\n",
    "    - Need less training data\n",
    "    - Highly scalable. It scales linearly with the number of predictors and data points\n",
    "    - Can be used for both binary and mult-iclass classification problems\n",
    "    - Can make probabilistic predictions\n",
    "    - Handles continuous and discrete data\n",
    "    - Not sensitive to irrelevant features\n",
    "\n",
    "**- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes assumes that all predictors (or features) are independent, rarely happening in real life. This limits the           applicability of this algorithm in real-world use cases.\n",
    "    - This algorithm faces the ‘zero-frequency problem’ where it assigns zero probability to a categorical variable whose             category in the test data set wasn’t available in the training dataset. It would be best if you used a smoothing               technique to overcome this issue.\n",
    "    - Its estimations can be wrong in some cases, so you shouldn’t take its probability outputs very seriously. \n",
    "\n",
    "**- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is easy to train and fast to implement even with our big number of features.\n",
    "\n",

    "**- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.**\n",
    "Adaboost (and other boosting algorithms) are widely in self-driving car as they are referred as decision matrix algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - AdaBoost and any kind of boosting is resistant to overfitting, while still being accurate.\n",
    "    - Works really well on non-linear relationships, which translates into better prediction accuracy on the problem of               interest\n",

    "The boosting method means that the algorithm is combining many weak, simple learners to make accurate predictions. A weak learner is a classifier (Decision Tree, Bagging, etc...) that produces some predictions that are, at least, slightly better than random guessing (Random guessing is equivalent to 50%, life flipping a coin for instance).\n",

    "AdaBoost works by creating a highly accurate classifier by combining many relatively weak and inaccurate classifiers. AdaBoost, therefore, acts as an overarching algorithm, which allows you to use it as a wrapper for other classifiers. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers added at each round of boosting are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to set weights to both classifiers and data points (samples) in a way that forces classifiers to concentrate on observations that are difficult to correctly classify. This process is happening sequentially. The two weights are adjusted at each step as iterations of the algorithm proceed. \n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

Age ranks second, but I am assuming it is correlated with capital-loss and gain since older people tends to have more capital than others.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
